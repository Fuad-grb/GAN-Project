# GAN Project

This repository contains the "GAN-Project.ipynb" notebook which demonstrates the implementation and training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The GAN is trained to generate digit images that mimic those in the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **PyTorch Implementation**: Utilizes PyTorch for building and training the GAN models, ensuring efficient computation and ease of model scaling.
- **MNIST Digit Generation**: Trains on the MNIST dataset to generate digit images, showcasing the power of GANs in generating new, realistic images from learned distributions.
- **Model Architecture**: Includes separate classes for the Discriminator and Generator models, with detailed layer configurations and activation functions.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment to begin training the GAN and see the generated digit images.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the model or experiment with different architectures are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
